## Overview

This page will give you an introduction to the 80% of React concepts that you will use on a daily basis.

You will learn
* How to create and nest components
* How to add markup and styles
* How to display data
* How to render conditions and lists
* How to respond to events and update the screen
* How to share data between components

## Creating and nesting components

React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. 

```
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```

Now that you’ve declared MyButton, you can nest it into another component:

```
export default function MyApp() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
            <MyButton />
        </div>
    ) ;
}
```

The result:

```
function MyButton() {
    return (
      <button>
        I'm a button
      </button>
    );
  }
  
export default function MyApp() {
    return (
        <div>
        <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
        <MyButton />
        </div>
    );
}
```
## Writing markup with JSX

JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like &lt;br /&gt;. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:

```
function AboutPage() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello there. <br />How do you do?</p>
        </>
    )
}
```

Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:

```
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

React does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML. 

## Adding styles

In React, you specify a CSS class with className. It works the same way as the HTML class attribute:

```
<img className="avatar" />
```

## Displaying data

JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display user.name:

```
return (
  <h1>
    {user.name}
  </h1>
);
```

You can also “escape into JavaScript” from JSX attributes, but you have to use curly braces _instead_ of quotes. 

```
return (
  <img className="avatar" src={user.imageUrl} />
);
```

You can put more complex expressions inside the JSX curly braces too, for example, string concatenation:

```
const user = {
  name: 'Hedy Lamarr',
  imageUrl: 'https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg',
  imageSize: 90,
};

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={user.imageUrl}
        alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}
        style={{
          width: user.imageSize,
          height: user.imageSize
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}

```

In the above example, style={{}} is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={ } JSX curly braces. You can use the style attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.

## Conditional rendering

In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:

```
let content;
if (isLoggedIn) {
  content = <AdminPanel />;
} else {
  content = <LoginForm />;
}
return (
  <div>
    {content}
  </div>
);
```

If you prefer more compact code, you can use the conditional ? operator. Unlike if, it works inside JSX:

```
<div>
  {isLoggedIn ? (
    <AdminPanel />
  ) : (
    <LoginForm />
  )}
</div>
```

When you don’t need the else branch, you can also use a shorter logical && syntax:

```
<div>
  {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
</div>
```


## Rendering lists

You will rely on JavaScript features like for loop and the array map() function to render lists of components.

For example, let’s say you have an array of products:

```
const products = [
  { title: 'Cabbage', id: 1 },
  { title: 'Garlic', id: 2 },
  { title: 'Apple', id: 3 },
];
```

Inside your component, use the map() function to transform an array of products into an array of <li> items:

```
    const listItems = products.map(product =>
    <li key={product.id}>
        {product.title}
    </li>
    );

    return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    );
```

Notice how <li> has a key attribute. For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React uses your keys to know what happened if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items.

```
const products = [
    { title: 'Cabbage', isFruit: false, id: 1 },
    { title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 },
    { title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 },
  ];
  
  export default function ShoppingList() {
    const listItems = products.map(product =>
      <li
        key={product.id}
        style={{
          color: product.isFruit ? 'magenta' : 'darkgreen'
        }}
      >
        {product.title}
      </li>
    );
  
    return (
      <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    );
  }
```
## Responding to events

You can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside your components:

```
function MyButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```
Notice how onClick={handleClick} has no parentheses at the end! Do not call the event handler function: you only need to pass it down. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.

## Updating the screen

Often, you’ll want your component to “remember” some information and display it. For example, maybe you want to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add state to your component.

First, import useState from React:

```
import { useState } from 'react';
```
Now you can declare a state variable inside your component:
```
function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // ...
```

You’ll get two things from useState: the current state (count), and the function that lets you update it (setCount). You can give them any names, but the convention is to write [something, setSomething].

The first time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because you passed 0 to useState(). When you want to change state, call setCount() and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter:

```
function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

React will call your component function again. This time, count will be 1. Then it will be 2. And so on.

If you render the same component multiple times, each will get its own state. Click each button separately:

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

Notice how each button “remembers” its own count state and doesn’t affect other buttons.

## Using Hooks

Functions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the [API reference](https://react.dev/reference/react). You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.

Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.
